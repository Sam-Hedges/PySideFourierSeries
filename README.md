# PySide + Fourier Series Toy Project

This is a small toy project I’m making to learn PySide. The idea is to create a simple app where you can choose an SVG and see it represented as a Fourier series of vectors, or something like that, since I haven’t fully figured out the details yet.

It’s mainly just a sandbox for me to experiment with PySide and play around with Fourier series in a visual, interactive way.
