# PySide + Fourier Series Toy Project

This is a small toy project I’m making to learn PySide. The idea is to create a simple app where you can choose an SVG and see it represented as a Fourier series of vectors, or something like that, since I haven’t fully figured out the details yet.

It’s mainly just a sandbox for me to experiment with PySide and play around with Fourier series in a visual, interactive way.

# TODO

- [ ] Finish this todo list
- [ ] Import svg gui (Filepath field, File-Exp Btn, Filename Label, Metadata Label)
- [ ] Draw nice graph view for the vectors to be drawn onto
- [ ] Figure out how animations will work for drawing svg
- [ ] Investigate splitting code out into multiple files
